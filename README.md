# Emotiv Interface

This repository is part of the **Hot and Cold Game**. 

The Hot and Cold is a game where the player commands a wheeled robot (Turtlebot3 Waffle) with the brain (EMOTIV Insight 5 channel mobile EEG) guiding it to a goal. The purpose of **emotivinterface** is to serve a REST/JSON API for reading the EMOTIV signals.
